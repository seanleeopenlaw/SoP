# Supabase Connection Diagnostic Results

## Test Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Project Reference Tested**: `rcaitnenussgesnxlimp`
**Password Tested**: `PeopleProject2025!`

## Test Results

### Tests Performed:
1. ✅ DNS resolution for pooler endpoints - **SUCCESSFUL**
2. ✗ Direct connection to `db.rcaitnenussgesnxlimp.supabase.co` - **FAILED** (DNS not found)
3. ✗ Session pooler (port 5432) across 10 AWS regions - **FAILED** (All regions)
4. ✗ Transaction pooler (port 6543) - **FAILED**
5. ✗ Various username formats - **FAILED**

### Error Messages:
- **Pooler connections**: `FATAL: Tenant or user not found`
- **Direct connection**: `getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND db.rcaitnenussgesnxlimp.supabase.co`

## Diagnosis

The consistent "Tenant or user not found" error across **all AWS regions** combined with DNS resolution failure for the direct connection strongly indicates:

### **PRIMARY ISSUE: Invalid Credentials** (99% certainty)

One or more of the following is incorrect:
1. **Project Reference**: `rcaitnenussgesnxlimp` may not be correct
2. **Database Password**: `PeopleProject2025!` may not match
3. **Project Status**: The project may be paused, deleted, or never fully initialized

### Why We Know This:

1. **DNS Failure**: The hostname `db.rcaitnenussgesnxlimp.supabase.co` doesn't resolve, suggesting this project reference doesn't exist in Supabase's DNS
2. **Universal Tenant Error**: Getting "Tenant or user not found" across all regions means the username format `postgres.rcaitnenussgesnxlimp` is not recognized
3. **Pooler Reachability**: The pooler endpoints themselves are reachable (DNS resolves), but authentication fails

## REQUIRED ACTION

**You MUST manually verify the following in your Supabase dashboard:**

### Step 1: Verify Project Exists
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Check if the project appears in your projects list
3. **If you don't see it**: The project was deleted or never existed

### Step 2: Get Correct Project Reference
1. Click on your project in the dashboard
2. Look at the URL bar: `https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/[PROJECT_REF]`
3. The `[PROJECT_REF]` in the URL is your **ACTUAL** project reference
4. Compare it to: `rcaitnenussgesnxlimp`
5. **If they don't match**: Use the correct one from the URL

### Step 3: Check Project Status
Look for status indicators in the dashboard:
- **"Paused"** → Click "Restore" to reactivate
- **"Active"** → Good, continue to next step
- **"Deleted"** or missing → You'll need to create a new project

### Step 4: Get Official Connection Strings

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT manually construct connection strings!

1. In your project, go to: **Settings > Database**
2. Scroll to **"Connection string"** section
3. You'll see several connection string types:
   - **Session pooler**
   - **Transaction pooler**
   - **Direct connection**

4. Click on each to reveal the full string
5. **Copy the EXACT strings** provided

6. Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with your database password
   - If unsure, click **"Reset database password"** and set a new one

### Step 5: Update .env File

Use the EXACT connection strings from Step 4:

```bash
# Session pooler (recommended for DATABASE_URL)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres.[PROJECT_REF]:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-[REGION].pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres"

# Transaction pooler (recommended for DIRECT_URL)
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://postgres.[PROJECT_REF]:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-[REGION].pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres"

ADMIN_EMAILS="admin@openlaw.com.au"
```

**Password Encoding**:
- If your password contains special characters, URL-encode them:
  - `!` → `%21`
  - `@` → `%40`
  - `#` → `%23`
  - `$` → `%24`
  - `%` → `%25`
  - Example: `PeopleProject2025!` → `PeopleProject2025%21`

### Step 6: Test Connection

After updating .env:

```bash
# Test with Prisma
npx prisma db pull

# Or run the test script
node test_db_connection.mjs
```

### Step 7: Clean Up and Restart

```bash
# Kill any running processes
# Remove test files
rm test_db_connection.mjs test_all_regions.mjs

# Restart your development server
npm run dev
```

## What If None of This Works?

If you've verified everything and it still doesn't work:

1. **Create a new Supabase project**:
   - Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Click "New project"
   - Note the new project reference
   - Copy the connection strings immediately

2. **Migrate your schema**:
   ```bash
   # Update .env with new project connection strings
   # Then push your Prisma schema
   npx prisma db push
   ```

## Current .env File

Location: `/Users/seanlee/Desktop/PeopleProject/.env`

Current contents:
```bash
# Session pooler connection (supports IPv4 and IPv6, recommended for local development)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres.rcaitnenussgesnxlimp:PeopleProject2025%21@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres"

# Transaction pooler connection for migrations and schema operations
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://postgres.rcaitnenussgesnxlimp:PeopleProject2025%21@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres"

# Admin Authentication
ADMIN_EMAILS="admin@openlaw.com.au"
```

**Status**: These connection strings do NOT work. They need to be replaced with correct values from your Supabase dashboard.

---

## Summary

**Bottom Line**: The provided project reference `rcaitnenussgesnxlimp` and/or password `PeopleProject2025!` are incorrect or the project doesn't exist.

**Required Action**: Manually verify credentials in Supabase dashboard and copy the exact connection strings.

**Next Step**: Log into https://supabase.com/dashboard and follow Step 1-7 above.
